/**
 * EPON_mac class is actually the EtherMAC2 class modified. From the
 * INET framework documentation:
 *
 * "A simplified version of EtherMAC. Since modern Ethernets typically
 * operate over duplex links where's no contention, the original CSMA/CD
 * algorithm is no longer needed. This simplified implementation doesn't
 * contain CSMA/CD, frames are just simply queued and sent out one by one."
 *
 * We use this class for some basic operations. The first one (and most
 * important) is to change the way the frame is transmitted. On EPON network
 * the Ethernet pre-amble includes the LLID (Logical Link ID). This LLID is
 * carried, from the higher layers, inside the cMessage ControInfo. Thus what
 * we do here is too remove the ControlInfo and use them in EtherFrameWithLLID.
 * The original message is encapsulated inside this frame. Finally the preamble
 * is added (-2 Bytes cause they are already in the EtherFrameWithLLID) and the
 * SFD. For incoming frame from the network we do the opposite process (decapsulate
 * the frame and add ControlInfo)
 *
 * The second usage of this module is to handle the IFG times that, based on the
 * drafts, should be there.
 *
 * Finally note here that the basic control of the transmission times is located
 * in the MacCtl modules (ONUMacCtl & OLTMacCtl), thus most of the times the queue
 * this module has is not used at all.
