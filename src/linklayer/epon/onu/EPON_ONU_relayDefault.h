/**
 * The default relay way. As mentioned in the MACVlanRelayUnitBase this
 * module is responsible for packet differentiation. The specific module
 * is based on the destination MAC address and is going to forward the frame
 * to all the known LLIDs. If the LLID is -1 (UNDEFINED) then the frame is
 * going to be broadcasted. The same will happen if we do not know any LLID
 * for that MAC address or if the ONU doesn't have any LLID assigned.
 *
 * NOTE here that mapping to LLIDs could be done with various ways based on the
 * VLAN or on the DSCP in the IP header or even per-port or pre-defined per
 * destination. Depending on the scenario, someone can extend the MACVlanRelayUnitBase
 * and change the relay's behavior.
